## Summary 

Social media platforms like Twitter have been a popular choice amongst researchers in the global health domain to gain insights through the vast amount of data available. Snakebite envenoming, a life-threatening disease caused by mixture of toxins following a snakebite, was added to the priority list of neglected tropical diseases by the World Health Organisation in June 2017. The purpose of this internship project at Manta Ray Media Ltd was two-fold. Unlike other global health ailments, little research has been published about text mining approaches such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis for tweets specifically related to snakebite. This study explores the topic distribution and sentiment of users discussing snakebite on twitter between July and December 2017. Secondly, an interactive web based visualisation application ‘SnakebiteViz’ was developed specifically for use as a communication tool by Manta Ray Media Ltd and other global health professionals to understand snakebite topics most discussed and shared by users and organisations on Twitter. Incorporation of spatial and temporal components in the visualisation design along with a visual representation of tweet sentiment, provided an easy to use platform for users to understand twitter behaviour specifically around snakebite."
